### Run Piscis in a Pipeline
The python script `spot_pipeline.py` will run the [piscis](https://github.com/zjniu/Piscis) spot-calling algorithm in a high-throughput manner given a dataset of smFISH microscopy images in `nd2` or `tiff` format. \
Spots can be called on multi- or single-channel images as well as stacks of images (Z stack) or flat images. 

#### File naming
The pipeline expects both image and mask files to contain the prefix `Location_XX_`, i.e. `Location_01_`, `Location_02_`, etc. The numbers need not be increasing or in numerical order, but this prefix **_must_** match between image files and their corresponding mask files. \
Example:
```
Image                        Mask
-----                        ----   
Location_01_A647_zStack.tif  Location_01_DAPI_MaxProj_cp_masks.tif 
Location_02_A647_zStack.tif  Location_02_DAPI_MaxProj_cp_masks.tif
Location_03_A647_zStack.tif  Location_03_DAPI_MaxProj_cp_masks.tif
...
```

#### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nuwah12/FISH-Spot-Calling.git
```
Before running the pipeline, I suggest installing and activating the conda environment defined in the .yml file `imagingEnv.yml`. It contains all packages in correct versions needed to run it. \
To install, copy the `yml` file to your local machine and run: 
```
conda env create -f imgagingEnv.yml
conda activate bigfish
```
To execute the pipeline, run
```
python3 piscis_pipeline.py [-h] settings.yml
```
The script takes one argument, the `settings.yml` file. All parameters related to spot calling and image processing are in this file - no other command line arguments are needed. \
The available arguments include:
##### Image arguments
* `image_dir`: Path to directory with image files. Please ensure the files to be analyzed are in one directory.
* `image_type`: Type of image to be analyzed. Currently supported options are `tif`/`tiff` and `nd2`
* `channels`: An array with one entry for each fluoresence channel in the image. The dimension containing channel information is inferred based on the size of this list.
  * **NOTE:** Please ensure the ordering of channels here is the same as it is in your image file, i.e. in the below example, channel 0 is "DAPI", channel 1 is "Cy3", and channel 2 is "A647".
* `mask_dir`: Path to directory with mask image files in the same format as the image files and `image_type`. Refer above for how images and masks are mapped together.
##### Spot calling 
* `piscis_thresh`: The `threshold` parameter for the piscis model. It should not be changed much. Check [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10862914/) for more information.
* `piscis_scale`: Piscis `scale` parameter
* `piscis_min_distance`: Piscis `minimum_distance` parameter
* `model`: The (string) representing the piscis model to be used. Only change if results are not looking good.
* `spot_channel`: The name of the channel from the above list to be used to call spots.
* `expand_mask`: Distance in pixels to expand each mask label by. Useful when only DAPI mask is available.
##### Plotting
* `plot_max`: Boolean; Make an interactive plot of all dots on the max-projected image.
* `plot_z`: Boolean; Interactive plot of all dots on their respective Z-slices.
* `plot_out_dir`: Directory to output interactive plots to in `html` format.

A properly formatted `settings.yml` would look like:
```
image_dir: "/path/to/image.tif"              
image_type: "tif"             
spot_out: "./spots"   

channels:                   
 - "A647"
 - "DAPI"
 - "Cy3"
spot_channel: "A647"        
stack: true                   
piscis_thresh: 1              
piscis_scale: 1                
piscis_min_distance: 1
expand_mask: 10        

model: "20230905"         

plot_max: true             
plot_z: true                    
plot_out_dir: "."        
```
